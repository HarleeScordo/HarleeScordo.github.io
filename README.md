## Documented Data Intake & Validation Framework (R)

Built a reproducible R-based data intake framework that ingests heterogeneous CSV/Excel sources, generates human-readable data catalogs, enforces schema contracts, and produces validation artifacts suitable for regulated or enterprise analytics environments.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Documentation-first data engineering in R
- Robust ingestion of messy CSV/XLSX sources
- Automated generation of human-readable data catalogs
- Schema contracts and validation with explicit outputs
- Reproducible execution using renv
- Separation of reusable logic and executable entry points

## Data Comparison & Validation Reporting (CSV vs Parquet)

Developed a structured difference reporting workflow to compare outputs generated from CSV and Parquet pipelines.
This solution enables rapid identification of discrepancies when validating new code changes or data transformations, supporting safer releases and regression checks.

Key capabilities:
- Column-level comparisons
- Row-level difference detection
- Output formatted for rapid review by analysts and developers

### Technology Trends Dashboard

Designed dashboards highlighting the top 10 nationally in-demand:
- Programming languages
- Databases
- Platforms
- Web frameworks
Visualizations were structured to support comparative analysis and executive-level consumption.

### Survey Analytics Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard analyzing survey responses across:
- Gender
- Age
- Geographic origin
- Education level
This project focused on filter-driven exploration and stakeholder-friendly storytelling.
