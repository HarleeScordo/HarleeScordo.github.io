### Projects

## Data Comparison & Validation Reporting (CSV vs Parquet)

Developed a structured difference reporting workflow to compare outputs generated from CSV and Parquet pipelines.
This solution enables rapid identification of discrepancies when validating new code changes or data transformations, supporting safer releases and regression checks.

Key capabilities:

Column-level comparisons

Row-level difference detection

Output formatted for rapid review by analysts and developers
